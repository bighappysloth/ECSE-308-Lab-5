    Prove two things
    \begin{enumroman}
    \item Prove that if $f:\real\to\real$ is continuous then for every closed set $K\subseteq\real$, $f^{-1}(K)$ is closed as well.
    \item Let $S=\{x\in\real,\, x^7 - 6x^3 \geq 4x^2 + 7\}$, show $S$ is closed using Part A.
    \end{enumroman}
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Part A]
    The inverse image preserves complements, so $f^{-1}(K^c)=f^{-1}(K)^c$, since $K^c$ is open, $f^{-1}(K^c)$ is open. And $f^{-1}(K^c)^c$ is closed.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Part B]
    Polynomials (univariate or otherwise) are continuous, after a simple induction on the degree of any polynomial $f$.\\
    
    Now, write $S=\{x,\, f(x)\geq 0\}$ for some polynomial $f(x)$, and it is clear that \[S = f^{-1}([0,+\infty))\]
    applying the first Part finishes the proof.
\end{proof}
