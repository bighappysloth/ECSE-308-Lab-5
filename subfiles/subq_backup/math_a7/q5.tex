    Determine if the following sets are open or closed, or neither. Prove your answers.
    \begin{enumroman}
        \item $(a,b]$ where $a<b$
        \item $\{x\in\real,\,x^3 + |x|-1<0 \text{ and } x>-10\}$
    \end{enumroman}
\end{wts}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Part A]
    Neither open or closed. Let $E = (a,b]$, we can construct a sequence $x_n = a+n^{-1}\to a$ which converges to a limit outside $E$. So $E$ is not closed. For every $\varepsilon>0$, $V_{\varepsilon}(b)$ is not contained entirely within $E$, so $E$ is not open either.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Part B]
    Let $E$ denote the set in question and $E=A\cap (-10,+\infty)$, it is clear that $(-10,+\infty)$ is open, it suffices to show that the left member,
    \[A = \{x\in\real,\,x^3 + |x|-1<0\}\]
    is an open set as well. Indeed, fix a sequence $\{x_n\}\subseteq A^c$ that is convergent to some $x\in\real$. By limit laws,
    \[x_nx_nx_n + |x_n|-1\to x^3 + |x|-1 \leq 0\]
    and $x\in A^c$, so $A$ is open. Therefore $E$ is open by closure under finite intersections.
\end{proof}
