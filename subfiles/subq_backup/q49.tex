\begin{wts}
    Show that every sequentially compact space is countably compact. \begin{itemize}
    \item Sequential compactness: every sequence has a convergent subsequence.
    \item Countably Compact: every countable open cover has a finite subcover.
    \end{itemize}
\end{wts}

\begin{proof}
    We will proceed by proving the contrapositive. Suppose $\xx$ admits a countable open cover where no finite subcover exists. Denote this open cover by $\{U_n\}_{n\geq 1}$. Since $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ is finite, we can choose a sequence 
    \[x_n\in \xx\setminus \left(\bigcup U_{j\leq n}\right)\neq\varnothing\]
    And suppose by contradiction that $x_n$ admits a convergent subsequence in $x_k\to x\in \xx$. We claim that $x\in X\setminus\left(\bigcup U_{j\geq 1}\right)$. Indeed, if\[x\in \bigcup U_{j\geq 1}\implies x\in U_j\]
    for some $j\in \nat^+$. So that $U_j$ is an open set that contains $x$ but only finitely many $x_k$. Therefore $x_k\not\to x$ for every subsequence $x_k$ of $x_n$, and the proof is complete.
