What is the status code of the first response message? What does this code indicate? What code is returned if the requested file cannot be found on the server?
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
The frames exchagned are, prior to data transfer,m
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Probe request,
        \item Probe response,
        \item Acknowledgement,
        \item Authentication,
        \item Association request,
        \item Key,
        \item Clear-to-send,
        \item Beacon Frame
    \end{itemize}
    If we want to multiply $(x^5 + x^2 + 1)(x^3+1)$, we write the coefficients of the two polynomials in the form
\[
(x^5 + x^2 + 1)(x^3+1)\iff (5,\,2,\,0)(3,\,0)
\]
Find the set of sums across the two tuples, given by
\[
(8,\,5,\,5,\,2,\,3,\,0)
\]
Then retain only the ones that have an odd number of terms (here the two $5$ cancel out), and we get
\[
(8,\,3,\,2,\,0)\iff x^8 + x^3 + x^2 + x^0
\]
Let us try with another example with $(1+x)(x+x^2)$
\[
(1+x)(x+x^2)\iff (1,\,0)(1,\,2)
\]
The set of sums is $(2,\,3,\,1,\,2)$, and flipping the required coefficients we get
\[
(3,1)\implies (1+x)(x+x^2) = x^3 + x
\]
\subsubsection*{Long Division of Polynomials in GF(2)}
Assume that $G(X) = (3,0) = x^3 + x^0$, and $D(X) = (3,1,0) = x^3 + x^1 + x^0$, if we wish to find $R(X)$ then we wish to find the remainder of $\frac{X^{3}D(X)}{G(X)}$
