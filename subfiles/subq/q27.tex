Examine the DNS response message. How many “answers” are provided in this message? What do each of these answers contain?
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
\begin{proof}
Let $n = 80$ bits. Using the Binomial distribution, it is trivial to verify that
\subsubsection*{Part A}
The probability there is one error bit in the frame is given by 
\[
P(k=1) = \binom{n}{1}p(1-p)^{n-1} = 0.0739
\]
\subsubsection*{Part B}
The probability that there is at least one error is given by
\[
P(k\geq 1) = 1 - (1-p)^n = 0.0769
\]

\subsubsection*{Part C}
The probability of a frame error given $m=n/2 = 40$ is
\[
P^m(k\geq 1) = 1-(1-p)^m = 0.0392
\]
