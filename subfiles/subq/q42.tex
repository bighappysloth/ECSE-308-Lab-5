How many TCP segments are transmitted to your computer? Why multiple segments are required to retrieve this single HTML file? 
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
Consider the following excerpt of the Beacon Frame.
    \begin{lstlisting}
        Tag: Supported Rates 1(B), 2(B), 5.5(B), 11(B), 18, 24, 36, 54, [Mbit/sec]
        Tag Number: Supported Rates (1)
        Tag length: 8
        Supported Rates: 1(B) (0x82)
        Supported Rates: 2(B) (0x84)
        Supported Rates: 5.5(B) (0x8b)
        Supported Rates: 11(B) (0x96)
        Supported Rates: 18 (0x24)
        Supported Rates: 24 (0x30)
        Supported Rates: 36 (0x48)
        Supported Rates: 54 (0x6c)\end{lstlisting}
\end{proof}
