What IP addresses are returned by these two queries? Do they return the same IP addresses for \lstinline{www.google.com} ? Explain your answer.

\begin{proof}
Client wants the server to mind its window size in order to not overflow and cause packet loss. 
And for the server to configure its left window edge so that it is ready for the next Segment from the client. The client awaits the \code{ACK = x + 1} (modulo $N$), where
\begin{equation}\label{mod n}
N = \sup\biggl\{\norm{x},\,x\in\mathbb{B}^{32}\biggr\}\end{equation}

The server sends the second segment, with flags \code{SYN = 1}, and \code{ACK = x+1}, \code{SEQ = y}, and widow size $W_S$,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Window size $W_s$, the maximum number of bytes the client should send without receiving an ACK from the server
    \item $SEQ_S$: Initial sequence number, a 32-bit number.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{proof}
