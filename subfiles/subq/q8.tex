    \begin{itemize}
        \item - when a group of subnets are aggreated via route aggregation, can combine into a single bigger subnet.
        \item the number of allowed subnets within a given CIDR block is 2 more than the number of hosts. this is because the ‘slash’ prefix distinguishes between subnet number 0, and the supernet itself.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}
